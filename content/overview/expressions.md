### Mathematical Operations

Cue has the typical math operations for numbers.
Multiplication also works for strings and lists.

{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/math-ops.html" lhsTitle="math-ops.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/math-ops-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval math-ops.cue"
>}}

Additional math operations can be found in the Cue's
{{< cuedoc page="/pkg/math" >}}math package{{</cuedoc>}}.

### Comparison Operations

Cue has the expected relative comparison operators and semantics.
Equality checks are handled by value unification.

{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/compare-ops.html" lhsTitle="compare-ops.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/compare-ops-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval compare-ops.cue"
>}}

### Predefined Bounds

Cue has the following predefined bounds for sized numbers

```text
int8      >=-128 & <=127
int16     >=-32_768 & <=32_767
int32     >=-2_147_483_648 & <=2_147_483_647
int64     >=-9_223_372_036_854_775_808 & <=9_223_372_036_854_775_807
int128    >=-170_141_183_460_469_231_731_687_303_715_884_105_728 &
              <=170_141_183_460_469_231_731_687_303_715_884_105_727

uint      >=0
uint8     >=0 & <=255
uint16    >=0 & <=65536
uint32    >=0 & <=4_294_967_296
uint64    >=0 & <=18_446_744_073_709_551_615
uint128   >=0 & <=340_282_366_920_938_463_463_374_607_431_768_211_455

rune      >=0 & <=0x10FFFF
```

### Regular Expressions

Cue supports regular expression constraints with the `=~` and `!~` operators.


{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/regexp.html" lhsTitle="regexp.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/regexp-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval regexp.cue"
>}}

They are based on [Go's regular expressions](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).
Cue also has some additional {{<cuedoc page="/pkg/regexp" >}}regexp helpers{{</cuedoc>}}.



### Interpolation

Cue supports interpolation in strings and bytes with `\(<expr>)`.

{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/interpolate.html" lhsTitle="interpolate.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/interpolate-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval interpolate.cue"
>}}

For more complicated scenarios, you can use the {{< cuedoc page="/pkg/text/template" >}}text/template{{</cuedoc>}} package.

You can also interpolate field names (as we will see shortly).


### List Comprehensions

Cue has list comprehensions to dynamically create lists.
You can iterate over both lists and struct fields.

The form is `[ for key, val in <iterable> [condition] { production } ]`

\* `key` is the index for lists and the label for fields

{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/list-comp.html" lhsTitle="list-comp.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/list-comp-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval list-comp.cue"
>}}


### Field Comprehensions

Cue also has the ability to comprehend fields.

{{< chromaDouble
  lhsPath="code/overview/expressions/field-comp.html" lhsTitle="field-comp.cue"
  rhsPath="code/overview/expressions/field-comp-out.html" rhsTitle="cue eval field-comp.cue"
>}}

### Conditional Fields

Conditional fields, or guarded fields (if technically means guard), are another form of field comprehension.

Some important notes to make from the usual understanding of ifs:

- there is not an else statement; you have to have two ifs with opposite conditions
- there is no short-circuiting of booleans; all conditions will be evaluated
